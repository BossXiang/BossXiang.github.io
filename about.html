        Hello, my name is Wen-Hsiang Cheng, but you can call me Tom. I am a highly motivated and accomplished individual with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Information Engineering from NTUST, the best industrial university in Taiwan. Iâ€™m the person that when I set a goal, I am committed to working hard and persevering until I achieve it. My determination and resilience are reflected in my academic performance during my Bachelor's degree, where I consistently ranked among the top performers and received the academic excellence award every semester.

        Throughout my journey, I have gained valuable experiences in various roles across different projects. I have worked as a UI/UX designer, a frontend developer, a backend developer, and even as a full-stack game developer. These diverse experiences have equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a deep understanding of the software development process.
      </p>

        Moreover, I have a strong passion for continuous learning. I am always eager to explore new technologies and embrace fresh challenges. This drive for learning enables me to adapt to this rapidly-changing dynamic environment.
